# ObjPlacer-VirtualButtons

This project makes use of virtual buttons and 2 different image targets.

There are 2 panels in the UI. The left panel with 6 buttons, 1 button for each building style, lets the user select which building will be spawned when the user taps on the wood chips image target on the left. The right panel  will let the user hide/show or delete all of the spawned objects on the left image target.

For the right image target, the stones one, there are three virtual buttons, one each on the left, center, and right. Hovering or pressing one of these virtual buttons will show the building tied to that virtual button. If the button is not pressed, the corresponding building will not be shown.
